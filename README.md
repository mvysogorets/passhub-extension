# Chrome extension for PassHub


The extension is a helper tool for the PassHub.net web site. 

PassHub.net is a stand-alone web password manager. PassHub employs WWPass technology for strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) and client-side encryption. PassHub features credentials, notes, and file storage combined with fine-grained sharing capabilities. PassHub interface resembles well-known KeePass architecture. In addition, PassHub is fully export/import compatible with KeePass, the password manager of choice for IT professionals.
